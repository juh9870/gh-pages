KNOWN ISSUES (Only Windows of course)

- There is no interaction between the window manager
  and the program. Please use the program's close or
  delete functions to closa a graphics window.

- Windoze mouse event handling is error prone.
  Routines using interactive mouse input in 
  an idl graphics window might catch a mouse event 
  in case the mouse cursor is positioned in a 
  window on top of the graphics window.
  Simply keep the idl graphics window on top.
  Does not happen in well behaved Unix environments.
