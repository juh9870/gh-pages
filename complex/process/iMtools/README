INSTALLATION
------------

Apple Mac OS X

prerequisites: Apple's X11.app (available from www.apple.com), 
               IDL virtual machine installed in a unix binary path
	       (available from www.ittvis.com)

(1) move the whole iMtools folder to the system-wide /Applications folder 
(2) double-klick on the iMtools icon to launch the program

The iMtools Cocoa Application is just a launcher. It dies immediately
after launching. This is the expected behaviour! It may take a few
seconds until the IDL VM window pops up. Simply be patient. 



LinuX

prerequisites: X11  
               IDL virtual machine installed in a unix binary path
	       (available from www.ittvis.com)

(1) move the whole iMtools folder e.g. to /usr/local 
(2) change directory to the installation path and launch iMtools 
    using the command 'idl -vm=iMtools.sav'
    You may want to create a shell script in a unix binary path
    to do that for you.



Windows

prerequisites:  
               IDL virtual machine
	       (available from www.ittvis.com)

(1) move the whole iMtools folder anywhere you want 
(2) double-klick on the iMtools.sav icon to launch the program
